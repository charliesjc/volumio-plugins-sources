# Roonumio

Roonumio is a plugin for Volumio 3 that allows you to use the Roon Bridge software provided by Roon and display the track metadata in Volumio.

## THIS PROJECT IS WORK-IN-PROGRESS
This plugin is completely work-in-progress and will likely cause problems with your Volumio installation. There is still a lot to be done before it even reaches the testing phase.

## Acknowledgements

This plugin was inspired and started out based entirely on Christopher Rieke's [RoonBridge plugin](https://github.com/crieke/volumio-plugins-sources), which is also a plugin for Volumio 3, but lacks any interfacing at all with Volumio.
